# FreezeTag
Hello Github Peepz,

Welcome to the FreezeTag Minigame made by CavinMiana the owner of FreshProjectz!

This Minigame is basically a game you play outside with your friends and stuff. I have now ported into minecraft and added all these features to the minigame.

This Minigame requires another server to play on. So when a player like go's through a portal or something they will teleport to that server and the game will already start! It will need at least 12 people to play. It can also hold 16 people. 

The minigame has two teams. Taggers and Hiders. The taggers will try to tag/freeze the hiders team. If they tag all of them they win the game! The hiders will hide from the taggers and they will be running away from the taggers just in case they get caught. If a hider gets tagged no worries another hider with a special stick can unfreeze the hider thats tagged.

This minigame has been made for a special server I was going to make!... but that all went away. And now i want to share all to you.

NOTE: Turn plugin into a phar and put the phar in the plugins folder.

# ENJOY!
